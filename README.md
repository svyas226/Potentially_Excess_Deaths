# Introdution/Overview
This repository presents a streamlit app analyzing potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas across the United States from years 2005 to 2015. Potentially excess deaths are those beyond what would typically be expected based on historical data, providing valuable insights into public health trends and disparities between different states and localities.

Potentially Excess Deaths = Observed Deaths - Expected Deaths

Understanding the patterns and drivers of excess mortality can inform targeted interventions and policy decisions aimed at reducing preventable deaths and improving overall population health outcomes. This analysis sheds light on the variations in excess mortality between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas, identifying potential areas for further investigation and intervention.


# Data Source
The dataset included in this repository comprises information on:

Five leading causes of death: Cancer, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease, Heart disease, Stroke, Unintentional injury
Locality: Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas in the United States
Timeframe: 2005-2015
The data is sourced from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Center for Health Statistics from which I was able to download the CSV file.

# Future Work
I would like to continue building this app to include the recent data and analyze the trends in potentially excess deaths from other causes of deaths as well. Additionally, the app would include a detailed demographics for a more a more granular analysis by age, gender, and ethnicity to identify which groups are most affected in which regions. The development of the app can also help to find any publich health challenges and create predictive models to forecast future trends in potentially excess mortality and assess impact of intervention strategies.
